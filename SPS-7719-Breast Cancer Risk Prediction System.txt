1.1 OVERVIEW
 	Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Most types of Breast cancer are easy to diagnose by mcroscopic analysis of a sample of the affected area of breast. Also there are types of breast cancer that require specialized lab examinations.
More than 3.8 milllion US women with a history of breast cancer were alive on January 1,2019. Approximately 1 in 8 women (13%) will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 39 (3%) will die from breast cancer. Life time risk is an average of risk for all women and accounts for death that may preempt a breast cancer diagnosis.  In order to improve breast cancer outcomes and survival, early detection is critical. There are two early detection strategies for breast cancer: early diagnosis and screening.  Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death, saving the lifes of many Hence, it is very important to detect this disease as early as possible.


1.2 PURPOSE
	The aim of the project is to increase the number of breast cancers identified at an early stage, thus helps to provide proper treatment as early as possible. Here, I use the machine learning algorithms to predict if a tumor is benign or malignant, based on the features provided by the data. Here,I am building a model in Watson Studio and deploying the model in IBM Watson Machine Learning. To interact with the model I use Node-Red and scoring Endpoint.

2. LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 EXISTING PROBLEM
	Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of propert treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy.Even thought early identification and diagnosis can significantly reduce the chances of death. This is a major existing problem in our present scenario.

2.2 PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution is to develop a model that is capable of detecting the Breast Cancer at its early stage. The Machine learning model is trained and deployed on IBM Watson Studio and an endpoint is created. The web application is built using IBM Node-Red. UI is provided and the details about tumor is collected and result is the prediction if the tumour is malignant or benign.

3. THEORETICAL ANLYSIS 

3.1. BLOCK DIAGRAM 
	

3.2. SOFTWARE DESIGNING
	The project is done on IBM Watson studio on integration with  IBM cloud object storage ,IBM Machine learning,and IBM Node Red. IBM cloud object storage acts as a storage. We train the model in IBM Watson Machine Learning and deploy them online. 
IBM Node Red provides the required UI.

4. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS 

4.1 DATA ANALYSIS AND PREPROCESSING
 Our dataset contain 569 samples in which 357 are benign and 212 are malignant breast cancer. The data columns is given by data.columns().The shape of dataset is (569,33).

The correlation heatmap shows the correlation between various features.


4.2 LINEAR SVM


	

A support vector machine(SVM) with a linear kernel  is employed here and an accuracy of about 97.20 percent is obtained. The confusion matrix is given in the above figure.

5. FLOWCHART


This complete project is done on IBM Watson studio on integration with IBM cloud object storage, IBM Machine learning and IBM Nodered.IBM Watson Machine Learning is used to train the model deploy them online. IBM cloud object storage is used for storage purpose. IBM Nodered provides the required UI.

6.RESULT


Here,we train a model using SVM classifier and it it's deployed online. The UI is provided by Node Red . The test accuracy is approximately 97.20 percent . The User Interface in which we need to enter the details to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign is shown in the figure above.

7. ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES
 The first advantage is that machines work faster than humans, so faster results would be obtained. Also, chances of error occurence can be avoided because a machine learning model will always give correct prediction while sometimes human doctors may end up with wrong conclusion. 
The disadvantage is that we need a dataset to train, which should contain many data values but the person may not be having sufficient data for the model to predict. It need about 30 features to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign. 

8. APPLICATIONS 
The application of this project is in Medical field. It can be employed to predict whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and hence treatment can be given accordingly.

 9. CONCLUSION
  Breast Cancer (BC) is the most frequent cause of a cancer death for women around the world. Hence, if this cancer id detected at its early stage, it would be greatly helpful to improve prognosis and therefore to avoid chances of death.  

10. FUTURE SCOPE
 This project and the model deployed has a great scope in future. Also,more features can be added to this model to make its more accurate and faster
